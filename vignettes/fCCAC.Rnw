\section{Introduction}
Computational evaluation of variability across sequencing datasets is a crucial step in genomic 
science, as it allows both to evaluate the reproducibility across biological or technical 
replicates, and to compare different datasets to identify their potential correlations. fCCAC 
is an application of functional canonical correlation analysis to assess covariance of nucleic 
acid sequencing datasets such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing 
(ChIP-seq). Detailed information about the methodology can be found in Madrigal (2016).


\section{Example}
Data used in the example correspond to H3K4me3 triplicates (wild-type H9-hESCs) downloaded 
from ArrayExpress (E-ERAD-191) and processed as in (Bertero et al., 2015). Aggregate sets 
of reproducible peaks from Bertero et al. were considered as genomic regions of interest 
in the analysis.  Region 40000000-48129895 in chromosome 21 was selected for the 
illustrative example shown in this vignette.

## hg19. chr21:40000000-48129895 H3K4me3 data from Bertero et al. (2015)


owd <- setwd(tempdir());


library(fCCAC);
bigwig1 <- "chr21_H3K4me3_1.bw";
bigwig2 <- "chr21_H3K4me3_2.bw";
bigwig3 <- "chr21_H3K4me3_3.bw";
peakFile <- "chr21_merged_ACT_K4.bed";
labels <- c( "H3K4me3", "H3K4me3","H3K4me3" );

r1 <- system.file("extdata", bigwig1,  package="fCCAC",mustWork = TRUE);
r2 <- system.file("extdata", bigwig2,  package="fCCAC",mustWork = TRUE);
r3 <- system.file("extdata", bigwig3,  package="fCCAC",mustWork = TRUE);
r4 <- system.file("extdata", peakFile, package="fCCAC",mustWork = TRUE);
ti <- "H3K4me3 peaks (chr21)" ;

fc <- fccac(bar=NULL, main=ti, peaks=r4, bigwigs=c(r1,r2,r3), labels=labels, splines=15, nbins=100, ncan=15);

head(fc);

setwd(owd); }

As we can observe, the triplicates present very high values both in first squared 
canonical correlation (>0.99) and in their F values, which denotes high 
reproducibility of the experiment.\\

Finally, if all pairwise comparisons have been computed ('tf=c()' by default), 
we can plot a heatmap of F values:

\begin{small}
<<heatmapPlot, fig=TRUE, include=TRUE, fig.width=1, fig.height=1.5>>=
options(width=60)
if (.Platform$OS.type != "windows"){ heatmapfCCAC(fc) }

@ 

\end{small}


\textbf{Important notes}: 
1. F is an overall measure of shared covariance. It is expected that good 
replicates will have F values close to 100 (such as in the example above).\\

2. Because heavy smoothing is suggested for functional CCA (Ramsay and 
Silverman (2005); Ramsay et al. (2009)), a low number of splines (parameter 
splines) when compared to the total length of the genomic regions is 
recommended. The parameter 'nbins' can be low for narrow peaks (e.g., 50 
for TFs and narrow chromatin marks) and increased for broad domain chromatin 
marks. The number of canonical correlations to compute (ncan) is limited by 
the number of splines used and the number of genomics regions to analyse. 
More information about data approximations used can be found in the 
Supplementary Information in Madrigal (2016).
